Transfer and TransferFrom

The ERC-20 standard includes both `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to provide two different mechanisms for moving tokens. Each serves a specific purpose and use case:

### `transfer` Function
- **Direct Transfers**: The `transfer` function is used to directly move tokens from the sender's address to another address. This function is typically called by the token owner.
- **Simplicity**: It's a simpler function that only requires the recipient's address and the amount to be transferred.
- **Typical Use**: This is the most common way that token holders move tokens between wallets or to other users.

Example Use Case:
```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
```
If Alice wants to send 10 tokens to Bob, she can directly call `token.transfer(bobAddress, 10)` from her wallet.

### `transferFrom` Function
- **Delegated Transfers**: The `transferFrom` function allows a third party (an address other than the token owner) to transfer tokens from one address to another, but only with the token owner's prior approval.
- **Approval Mechanism**: Before `transferFrom` can be used, the token owner must explicitly allow a spender to transfer a certain amount of tokens on their behalf using the `approve` function.
- **Typical Use**: This function is essential for enabling automated and conditional transfers, such as those done by smart contracts or DEXs (decentralized exchanges).

Example Use Case:
```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool);
```
If Alice wants to allow a DEX to take 10 tokens to provide liquidity, she calls `token.approve(dexAddress, 10)`. The DEX can later move up to 10 tokens from Alice's balance to any address by calling `token.transferFrom(aliceAddress, anyAddress, upTo10)`.

### Summary of Differences

- `transfer` is for a token holder to directly transfer their tokens.
- `transferFrom` is for an approved third party to transfer tokens on behalf of a token holder.
- `transferFrom` requires a two-step process (approve then transfer), while `transfer` is a single step.

The distinction between these functions is crucial for creating a secure and flexible token ecosystem, allowing both simple transfers and more complex interactions with contracts.
