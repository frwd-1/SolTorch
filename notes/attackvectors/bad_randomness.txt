One common example of bad randomness in Solidity is when a contract uses the block hash as a source of randomness. 
The block hash is a value that is derived from the contents of a block on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is considered to be unpredictable because it is based on the transactions and other data contained in the block. 
However, the block hash is not truly random because it is determined by the contents of the block, which may be known or predictable to an attacker.
