	II) Checks-Effects-Interactions
		a. In your code, first check the relevant state variable,
		b. Second piece of code needs to be implementation of the effects on the state variable
		c. Final line of code is to make the external call
			i. Make sure you update any state variable before you make external function calls
	III) Mutex Pattern
		a. Places a lock on some contract state, and only the owner of that lock can modify that state
		b. Basically you lock a contract while its being executed. 
		c. noReentrant modifier that checks whether locked is true
Once the function code has finished executing, the function is unlocked.
