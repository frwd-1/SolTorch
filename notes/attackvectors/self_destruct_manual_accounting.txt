Additional Notes and Warnings
        i. A contract without a receive Ether function can receive Ether as a recipient of a coinbase transaction (aka miner block reward) or as a destination of a selfdestruct.
            1) A contract cannot react to such Ether transfers and thus also cannot reject them. This is a design choice of the EVM and Solidity cannot work around it.
            2) It also means that address(this).balance can be higher than the sum of some manual accounting implemented in a contract (i.e. having a counter updated in the receive Ether function).
        ii. A payable fallback function is also executed for plain Ether transfers, if no receive Ether function is present. It is recommended to always define a receive Ether function as well, if you define a payable fallback function to distinguish Ether transfers from interface confusions.
